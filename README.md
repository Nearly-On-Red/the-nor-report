## Using

To report a message, simply hover over it. A large red report button should appear in the top right
After clicking this button, you will be presented with possible reasons for your report
Simply choose the one that fits best. The moderators will receive your report and will take action

## Installing

### I'm using Firefox, or another Gecko-based browser
Just visit https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/the-nor-report/ and click `Add to Firefox`

### I'm using Chrome on Linux, or another Chromium-based browser
- Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Nearly-On-Red/the-nor-report/releases), and right-click on the latest `chrome-nor_report-X.Y.Z.crx` file. Select the `Save as...` option to download the extension
- Open the extension settings in your browser by navigating to `chrome://extensions`, `chromium://extensions`, selecting `More Tools -> Extensions` in the dot menu, or another method appropriate to your browser
- Turn on developer mode in the top right corner
- Restart your browser
- Open the extension settings again and drag the `.crx` file you downloaded into the window. `Drop to install` should cover the screen. Let go to install the extension
- Check to make sure the extension appears in the list of extensions and does not display any errors

If these steps didn't work, for example with a `Package is invalid: 'CRX_REQUIRED_PROOF_MISSING'` error, or with the warning `This extension is not listed in the Chrome Web Store and may have been added without your knowledge.`, try the next method.

### I'm using Chrome on Windows or macOS, or a Chromium-based browser that restricts unsigned extensions (i.e. the previous option didn't work)
- Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/Nearly-On-Red/the-nor-report/releases), and download the latest `chrome_unpacked-nor_report-X.Y.Z.zip` file
- Unpack the archive in a location of your choice. It is recommended that you extract them into a containing folder. There should be four files, including `manifest.json`
- Open the extension settings in your browser by navigating to `chrome://extensions`, `chromium://extensions`, selecting `More Tools -> Extensions` in the dot menu, or another method appropriate to your browser
- Turn on developer mode in the top right corner
- Restart your browser
- Open the extension settings again and click `Load unpacked`. Select the folder that contains the files you unpacked
- Check to make sure the extension appears in the list of extensions and does not display any errors

If this didn't work either, try asking for help in the [NearlyOnRed Discord server](https://www.nearlyonred.com/discord/) or installing a good browser like Firefox.

### I'm using Safari, a mobile device, or a non-insider version of Edge
Sorry, but these platforms are not currently supported. If you want to report a message, you can contact moderators directly by using Twitch's whisper feature, or by using the [NearlyOnRed Discord server](https://www.nearlyonred.com/discord/). They don't bite... usually.
